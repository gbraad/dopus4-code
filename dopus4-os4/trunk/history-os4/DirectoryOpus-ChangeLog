DirectoryOpus - ChangeLog:
--------------------------

2006-09-19 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.29
* The status line now correctly shows the version number when nothing is
selected in ConfigOpus->System->Clocks.

2006-09-20 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.30
* ConfigOpus can now properly open on DirectoryOpus screen.

2006-09-24 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.31
* Extract comand added, it's a built-in function to unpack archives using
xadmaster.library.

2006-09-25 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.32
* Replaced the simplerequest()function with one that uses Intuition's
EasyRequest() instead.

2006-09-29 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.33
* Fixed a bug that occured when changing from IDOpus->Atoh(); to
IDOS->HexToLong(); instead.

2006-10-04 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.34
* Fixed wrong colors when DirectoryOpus was used on its own screen.

2006-10-07 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.35
* Fixed tons of deault keys for the GUI. Some has changed, some are just
improved. For the classic owners using numpad 7/1/9/3 is equall to use
home/end/pgup/pgdown keys on pc-keyboards. Numpad 8/2/4/6 can also be used
instead if the cursor keys. Some other changes as well.

2006-10-11 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.36
* Fixed serious renaming bug. Under certain conditions DO would just
overwrite a directory.

2006-10-20 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.37
* Really fixed key handling this time. IDCMP_VANILLAKEY broke IDCMP_RAWKEY
handling, so everything is rawkey now. Not as elegant, but works.

2006-10-30 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.38
* Added a replace requester to the Extract command. As of know it will
always show up. If/when I'm able to rewrite ConfigOpus it will be an
option there, same as copy replace.

2006-10-30 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.39
* Merged the About and Version requesters. I want to have Version free for
future use.

2006-11-01 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.40
* Fixed the "Directory Not Empty" requester, when using "leave" it
unselected dirs. Also changed the order of options given. It's "Delete",
"All", "Skip" and "Cancel" now.

2006-11-09 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.41
* Directories will now be re-read on deiconify. Since DOS notify is
disabled during iconification it won't update on changes.

2006-11-16 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.42
* Changed the sort order for "Sort by Date". Now it displays the oldest
entry at the top. Later changed this back seeing there were a lot more
poeple on the ML that wanted it to sort with newest entry at the top.

2006-12-24 - DirectoryOpus 4.18
* Release

2006-12-27 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.1
* Fixed "Extract" command under OS4 Final.

IDOS->Lock() and IDOS->Examine() calls.

2008-01-07 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.3
* Removed all lockandexamine() calls and replaced them with
IDOS->ExamineObjectTags() calls instead.

2008-09-18 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.4
* New recursive_delete() function. Hopefully it'll sk you to unprotect
files and dirs that are protected.

2008-09-18 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.5
* Made text in locale 64bit aware, and in the process fixed a crash bug.

2008-09-23 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.6

2008-11-28 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.19
* Initial 64bit support in listers.

2008-12-22 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.20
* Replaced R_GETBYTES in recurse() function with its own function using
IDOS->ExamineDir(). Should be a lot faster.

2008-12-22 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.21
* Same as above with R_HUNT.

2009-02-15 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.22

2012-08-08 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.38
* Fixed Hex search to work as described in the DirectoryOpus4 Amigaguide
  documentation. Entering "$" at the beginning of the search string

* Added release target for easier program releases.

2012-08-30 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.38 (data.c & dopusdata.h)
* Commented out unused variables to eliminate unnecessary compiler warnings.

2012-08-30 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.38 - (icondata.c)
* Added qualifier to quotes ("") in project icon DiskObject structure.

2012-08-30 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.38 (launchexternal.c)
* Corrected sprintf() conversion identifiers in dopus_print().

2012-09-01 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.38 (dopusproto.h & main12.c)
* The get_device_task() function was commented out because it's only
  use was replaced with IDOS->DevNameFromLock() in  main2.c

2012-09-01 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.38 (main2.c)
* Replaced code that uses get_device_task() to get a device name
  with an IDOS->DevNameFromLock() function call.

2012-09-28 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.38 (select.c)
* Replaced soft-link resolution code that uses deprecated functions
  Examine() and Readlink(). OS4 DOS automatically resolves soft links.
* Changed obsolete ST_SOFTLINK to ENTRY_LINK.

2012-09-28 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.38 (makelinkdata.c)
* Fixed makelink() function. Soft link creation was broken for OS4.
* Added missing IDOS->UnLock() in makelink() function.

  and ENTRY_DIRECTORY identifiers.

2012-09-28 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.38 (main.c)

* Changed string qualifier.

2012-09-28 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.38 (main18.c)
* Added DevNameFromLock() function call to eliminate errors when copying
  relative directory soft links.

2012-09-28 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.38 (main22.c)
* Changed addition of files to destination lister so that copied
  "linked" files are displayed as normal files.
* Added code to prevent a directory link "move" from deleting the files in
  in the linked directory. Since Dopus currently copys linked files instead
  of reproducing links, a destination directory with the same name as the
  the directory link was created and files copied from the linkded directory
  were deleted in the linked directory. The directory link was deleted after
  the copy but the linked directory became an empty directory. That's probably
  not what the user would expect so moving a directory link removes the link
  after copying but leaves the linked directory intact.

2012-10-02 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.38 (archive.c)
* Added setting of protection bits when extracting an archive.

2012-10-03 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.38 (main.c)

* Added a "read-protected" check in CopyFile() function to avoid
  unexpected destination file deletion.
* Fixes tracker bug #7 (In conjunction with changes to main22.c)
* Switched to a global buffer variable so that the same buffer can be used

  for all requesters.

2012-10-21 - main18.c
* Replaced IDOpus->CheckExist() function call in copymakedir() function

  checkexistreplace() function to new examineobject() function call to
  prevent errors when copying to a multi-assign directory.
* Replaced IDOpus->CheckExist() function call in checkexistreplace()
  function to new checkexist() function call to  prevent errors when
  copying to  a multi-assign directory.

2012-11-01 - dopusproto.h

  for "Continue search" requester.

2012-11-09 - buffers.c custom.c main.c main10.c main11.c main14.c
              main16.c main16.c main20.c main22.c
* Added display image identifier to simplerequest() function calls.

2012-11-09 - main17.c
* Updated simplerequest() function calls with image identifiers.
* Fixed several command failures that resulted from a previous
  change of case-insensitive string comparisons to case-sensitive
  string comparisons.
--Fixes tracker bug #10

2012-11-13 - main22.c
* Added a source window archive check to the MOVE command to eliminate
  an error that caused the file to be silently copied afterward.
-- Fixes tracker bug #17

  check at line 2003.
* Added display image identifier to simplerequest() function calls
  for all requesters.
* Fixed directory datestamp, protection & comment by adding a requester
  to choose between applying the change to the directory and all it's
  contents or just the directory itself. Previously, all files in the
  directory were changed which may not be what a user would expect.
-- Fixes tracker bug #9
* Eliminated extra DOS requester when attempting to copy a directory to
  a copy-protected device.
* Removed file deletion in FUNC_COPY that caused destination file loss
  if source file was read protected. Along with changes to CopyFile()
  function in main5.c this fixes tracker bug #7.

2012-11-18 - main.c

  Dopus4 will now open on Workbench when deiconified if the screen it
  was iconified from has been closed.
--Fixes tracker bug #12

2012-11-18 - main20.c

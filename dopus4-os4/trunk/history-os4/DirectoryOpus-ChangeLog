DirectoryOpus - ChangeLog:
--------------------------

2006-09-19 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.29
* The status line now correctly shows the version number when nothing is
selected in ConfigOpus->System->Clocks.

2006-09-20 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.30
* ConfigOpus can now properly open on DirectoryOpus screen.

2006-09-24 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.31
* Extract comand added, it's a built-in function to unpack archives using
xadmaster.library.

2006-09-25 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.32
* Replaced the simplerequest()function with one that uses Intuition's
EasyRequest() instead.

2006-09-29 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.33
* Fixed a bug that occured when changing from IDOpus->Atoh(); to
IDOS->HexToLong(); instead.

2006-10-04 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.34
* Fixed wrong colors when DirectoryOpus was used on its own screen.

2006-10-07 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.35
* Fixed tons of deault keys for the GUI. Some has changed, some are just
improved. For the classic owners using numpad 7/1/9/3 is equall to use
home/end/pgup/pgdown keys on pc-keyboards. Numpad 8/2/4/6 can also be used
instead if the cursor keys. Some other changes as well.

2006-10-11 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.36
* Fixed serious renaming bug. Under certain conditions DO would just
overwrite a directory.

2006-10-20 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.37
* Really fixed key handling this time. IDCMP_VANILLAKEY broke IDCMP_RAWKEY
handling, so everything is rawkey now. Not as elegant, but works.

2006-10-30 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.38
* Added a replace requester to the Extract command. As of know it will
always show up. If/when I'm able to rewrite ConfigOpus it will be an
option there, same as copy replace.

2006-10-30 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.39
* Merged the About and Version requesters. I want to have Version free for
future use.

2006-11-01 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.40
* Fixed the "Directory Not Empty" requester, when using "leave" it
unselected dirs. Also changed the order of options given. It's "Delete",
"All", "Skip" and "Cancel" now.

2006-11-09 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.41
* Directories will now be re-read on deiconify. Since DOS notify is
disabled during iconification it won't update on changes.

2006-11-16 - DirectoryOpus 4.17.42
* Changed the sort order for "Sort by Date". Now it displays the oldest
entry at the top. Later changed this back seeing there were a lot more
poeple on the ML that wanted it to sort with newest entry at the top.

2006-12-24 - DirectoryOpus 4.18
* Release

2006-12-27 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.1
* Fixed "Extract" command under OS4 Final.

2007-07-22 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.2
* Optimised some code to use IDOS->ExamineObjectTags() instead of old
IDOS->Lock() and IDOS->Examine() calls.

2008-01-07 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.3
* Removed all lockandexamine() calls and replaced them with
IDOS->ExamineObjectTags() calls instead.

2008-09-18 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.4
* New recursive_delete() function. Hopefully it'll sk you to unprotect
files and dirs that are protected.

2008-09-18 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.5
* Made text in locale 64bit aware, and in the process fixed a crash bug.

2008-09-23 - DirectoryOpus 4.18.6

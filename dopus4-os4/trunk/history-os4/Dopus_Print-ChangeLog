Dopus_Print - ChangeLog:
------------------------

Aug 8, 2012 - Dopus_Print 4.18.1
* The following new options were added to the Dopus Print GUI:

  *Ignore bottom margin
   Ignore bottom margin setting in Dopus Print settings and let
   the printer control the pagelength (bottom margin).

  *Add carriage return to formfeeds
   Add a carriage return to formfeeds for printers that don't
   automatically perform a carriage return when starting a new
   page.

  *Eject page before printing
   Eject a blank first page for printers (or drivers) that print
   a top line higher on the first page than on subsequent pages.

  *Initialize Printer
   Dopus Print previously initialized the printer by default. Since
   the latest OS4 printer prefs have an initialization option, the
   Dopus Print printer initialization is changed to an option so
   that multiple printer initializations can be avoided.

  * Added locale strings for new options in Dopus_Print GUI.

    Changed file/path buffer sizes as defined in include-os4/libraries/dopus.h.

ATTENTION!!!

All changes marked with '*' come from Paul Huxham's version of Directory
Opus 4. Do not expect that I'll be blindly importing all his changes. Some
of them are buggy, some don't make too much sense IMHO. Use the version you
like more.

limit now and is right-aligned so don't set the width too low or you'll
loose some digits from the beginning! The width for protection bits and
date is calculated automatically so they always fit.
- Performing Parent on root directory results in device list
- "Operation/General/FileMaster-like Parent" switch - makes listers acting

- 'QUERY UpdateFlags' and 'QUERY ViewPlayFlags' commands support new
ConfigOpus flags ('update lister while scanning' and 'view in window").
- When starting DOpus can specify a directory which should be read into
left lister overriding config file setting. Just put directory name in
command line when starting from CLI or double-click directory's icon on WB
with DOpus icon selected. Note that there's 29 chars limit for directory
name.
- Increased stack size for file viewer to 8kB.
- Replaced CreateProc() with CreateNewProc calls. This fixes numerous

* Fixed bug in quiting where if the stack was lowered crashed on exit.
* Fixed a bug where deleting an assign could intermittently cause crashes
  because of an uninitialized pointer
* Added a define (NODOPUSASSIGN) to enable using PROGDIR: instead of DOpus:
* Text view in window now opens on the same screen as directory opus 4.
* Localized all hard coded english strings
* User appicon can now be placed into S: or DOpus:S
* Removed tooltype QUIETGETDIR and moved it to configuration (see
  ConfigOpus).
* Removed "Quiet ReadDir" from the popup menu as its not something thats
  changed often. Its now in config.
* Removed tooltype SIZEKMGMODE and moved it to configuration (see
  ConfigOpus).
* Moved the Kilo/Mega/Giga mode in the popupmenu to a root level and
  renamed it "Size as K/M/G".
* You can specify your own appicon (for iconification) by putting an icon
  named "def_AppIcon.info" in DOpus:. If there isnt a file with that name,
  the regular appicon will be used.
* Rename now wont overwrite directories if you rename a directory and also
  shows different information (unlocalized as yet) depending on what is
  being renamed to what.

4.15e:
SKIPPED.

4.15d (03.11.2000):
- fixed SysInfo.library support (damn, I didn't know that OpenLibrary() is
case-sensitive!)
- fixed dead-lock when DOpus tried to read non-existing directory
- assigns can be removed using DELETE function on device list entries.
- fixed sorting by name code. '0A' is greater than '09' now.
- fixed wrong VIEWONWB tooltype format description

4.15c (29.10.2000):
- preliminary archive support (uses XADMaster which has shareware status,
register if you want to use it!). Supported functions: doubleclick
(excluding defined filetypes), Copy(As), xxxRead, CheckFit(for files
only!). Some other could work also but weren't tested. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!
If you dare to test any then don't forget to tell me the result.
- QUIETGETDIR and SIZEKMGMODE tooltypes added.
- WB screen parameters can be changed when DOpus is running on its own screen
(if DOpus is button/window-iconified it will be automatically uniconified)
- sorting by name pays attention to leading 0's
- removed some dead code, decreased memory usage a bit
- internal SHOW function can display OS3.5 icons (only 16 RGB4 colors now).
- some selected files weren't processed sometimes - fixed.
- MAKEDIR function doesn't work on empty/devicelist/dirtree listers anymore.
- File viewer can be opened on default public screen. Put VIEWONWB tooltype
in program's icon to activate that mode. Define window size with
VIEWONWB=left/top/width/height (default: 0/0/640/200).
- SysInfo.library support. Now DOpus can use that library for CPU usage
estimating instead of internal meter. Note that the library requires
Executive or SysMon to work. If none of them is running DOpus falls back to
internal meter. To enable SysInfo support put USESYSINFO tooltype in its
icon.
- to open XADmaster.library on startup use FORCEOPENXAD tooltype
(default: use only if already in memory)
- some more fixes for long filenames (any still left?)
- fixed DateStamp bug with filenames longer than 40 chars.
- browsing linked directories works now.

4.15b (02.10.2000):
- preliminary link support
- removed few dead assignments (from Jaroslav Pokorny's sources)
- ARexx results can be bigger than 256 chars without trashing memory.
- live lister prop update during reading a directory can be turned off
(currently available only through lister popupmenu and not saved in config
file)

4.15a (20.09.2000):
- K/M/G size display in lister (currently available only through lister popupmenu
and not saved in config file)

4.15
- public release

4.14j:
- Long filenames do not trash copy/move/delete progress window
- Sort popupmenu doesn't appear on device or buffer list
- Sort popupmenu should allow multiselection now (but it doesn't probably
due to popupmenu.library bug)
- File viewer supports files longer than 65535 lines now
- "DOpus already running" requester doesn't require Arexx anymore to work.

4.14i:
- removed lots (all?) pre-OS3.0 conditional code
- removed PowerPacker support completely (replaced by XFDMaster support)
- XFDMaster.library is opened only when needed and if it has already been
opened by another program. This prevents loading all decrunchers from libs:xfd/
directory. That feature can be overriden by setting FORCEOPENXFD tooltype
in program's icon or -x (case important!) argument if started from CLI.
- fixed canceling "DOpus already running" requester. Now it uses ARexx and
requires RexxMaster running to work. "Bring to front" option added.

4.14h:
- FPU-less 68060 correctly detected
- fixed incorrect displaying free space in K/M/G on titlebar for K's
- support for partitions bigger than 2G updated; maybe now it will work ;-)
- font screen opens with default width and height now
- corrected system alert if DOpus is started under too old kickstart

4.14g:
- If you answer 'Cancel' in "DOpus already running" requester then existing
DOpus window/screen is brought to front.
- Disk modules don't open on new screen when started asynchronously and DOpus
is working on its own screen.
- Font and print screens don't require mode promotion on GFX cards anymore.
- HUNT function do not show file names during scanning (only
directories). This speeds it up a lot.
- Support for partitions bigger than 2GB.
- 68060 FPU should be correctly reported now.

4.14f:
- Search function in file viewer supports all chars now (not upto $79 only)
- GetSizes functions do not show file names during scanning (only
directories). This speeds it up a lot.
- Fixed FPU recognition with 68060 CPU.

4.14e:
- XFDMaster doesn't use external decrunchers from libs:xfd drawer. It
should speed-up opening the library a lot.

4.14d:
- fixed bug in sort popup menu which caused incorrect active
sorting mode marking
- key shortcuts in file viewer are passed through keymap now so they should
work correctly on non-QWERTY keyboards
- U,D,T,B,S,P,Q key shortcuts in file viewer obey localization. X,J,N,C keys remained as
they're not localizable.
- file viewer uses XFDMaster instead of PowerPacker to read files.
- in file viewer reading of the file can be aborted with RMB (checked every
128kB).

4.14c:
- fixed bug in file viewer when TAB wasn't at the beginning of the line.
Uff, that was hard!
- minor corrections to iconify code (WB change during ButtonIconify or
WindowIconify still doesn't work!)

4.14b:
- Increased maximum displayed file name characters to 64.
- file viewer respects TABs

4.14a:
- Re-enabled DOPUS:libs/dopus.library search path for main program
- Default pattern for file selection by date is current day.
- Increased room for filesize in lister from 7 to 9 digits (Pavel Cizek)
- Removed 16 color limit for custom DOpus screen. DOpus still uses upto 16
colors for its GUI.
- DosType in DiskInfo function returns correct value for non-standard
filesystems.

4.14:
- public release

4.13h:
- removed possible race condition which could cause a freeze after processing files
when progress window was opened. But I don't really think it helps  ;-)
- re-enabled prop updating during directory reading.

4.13g:
- recompiled missing files with CHIP RAM bug.

4.13f:
- CHIP RAM problems finally solved! It was so simple...
- turned off propgadget update during directory reading (Pavel Cizek)
- additional keystrokes in file viewer: Space - PageDown (doesn't activate
scroll mode anymore!), BackSpace - PageUp, / - Search requester (Pavel
Cizek)
- prop updating turned off while directury reading to test speed-up (Pavel
Cizek).

4.13e:
- 'Sort by' popup menu added (requires popupmenu.library). Press RMB over
diskname bar to display it.

4.13d:
- standard version string for main program.
- allows CGX/P96 custom screens (still 16-color limit).

4.13c:
- partial workaround for GCC chip data bug. No more trashed gadgets, pointers or
appicon in main program. Expect trashed gfx in ConfigOpus and in
dopus.library functions. Final fix still to come.

4.13b:
- icon filename creation changed to the same as used by AmigaDOS
- removed 30 chars limit for ADDICON function (I wonder how many such
  limits still hide somewhere in the sources...)
- added screennotify.library support (if available) so DOpus doesn't block
WB screenmode changes anymore

4.13a:
- 68060 and RTG system support for Version requester.

4.13:
- long filename support (upto 107 characters)
- fixed stack problem when started from CLI.

4.12:
- recompiled with GCC 2.95.2 and PhxAss 4.39
- optimized for 68020 CPU
- directly uses memory pools in KickStart 3.0+.
- speeded-up file copying with progress indicator enabled (almost as fast
as in DOpus Magellan!)
- added up-to-date asyncIO routines (from aminet:dev/c/asyncio.lha)
- doesn't hang-up during copying/moving files anymore (probably due to new asyncIO
routines).

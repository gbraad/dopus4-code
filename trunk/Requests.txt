- Fixing number of items in progress indicator to real value

Partially done but doesn't work perfectly.

- Pattern for user-defined gadgets' background

I can add that after fixing more important things.

- Increasing menuitem limit

Is it really required? Actually there can be upto 100 menuitems defined.

- Internal decoding of GIF, PNG, JPG etc.

Won't be done. 3rd party viewers are very good at it. Besides I plan
datatypes support so internal decoders are useless.

- Correct printing on different paper sizes

Tough one. I don't have a printer nor access to US-sized sheets (ie.
Legal). I can try to fix it 'blindly' but it would require strong betatesters support.

- Integration with Scalos desktop

Well, I don't know Scalos nor use it so I don't know what integration could
be done. But looking at the sources I doubt if any integration can be done
easily (if ever).

- Making it DOpus5-like

I won't to that. It's practically impossible and I like typical 2-window
filemanagers. If you need DOpus5 functionality just go and but it!

- Warning requester when renaming directory to already existing name

Will be fixed soon

- Rolling backward devicelist when clicked with SHIFT pressed

I've checked the sources and it's not easy to do. Anyway I'll try to add
this feature.

- Selecting the size of copy buffer in Prefs

Currently that buffer is filesize-dependent and it should stay so. Rule
which controls it should be finetuned a bit anyway.

- 'Rename' option to "Overwrite' requester

I'll add that.

- More user commands for filetypes

I think it's possible :)

- Additional commands

Existing set is quite powerful but I don't see any reason why not to expand it
:)

- Using function multiple times in single command (ie. {o})

This is a must!

- Horizontal scroller for text-reader to avoid line wrapping.

It probably won't be done. Use another viewer for that.

- Iconify gadget in window dragbar (VisualPrefs compatible)

I like that idea :)

- 'Add icon' checkmark for MakeDir requester

I'll do that
